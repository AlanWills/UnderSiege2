// This file contains the declaration of the class World
// The World class does not have a copy constructor or an assignment operator, for the followign reasons:

// 1 	There's no need to copy construct or assign the World
// 2 	We wouldn't want to do this anyway, because the world can contain an arbitray amount of data
// 3 	These operations wouldn't work because the world is self-referencing:
//	 	the Tracer base class contains a pointer to the world. If we wrote a correct copy constructor for the 
// 	  	Tracer class, the World copy construtor would call itself recursively until we ran out of memory.
